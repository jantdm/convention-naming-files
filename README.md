# File Naming Convention

The following rules are optimized for maximum interoperability with local filesystems, web URLs, legacy file systems and human readability.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

+ File names MUST NOT contain spaces, periods, umlauts or any other special characters (other than "-"). Accepted characters are a-z, A-Z, -, and 0-9.
